# MNIST Digit Identification
Streamlit App | Source Code

Project Summary
This repository contains a machine learning application designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project integrates a Deep Learning backend using TensorFlow/Keras with a front-end interface built on Streamlit, providing a seamless pipeline from image processing to real-time classification.

Technical Features
Neural Network Architecture: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimized for spatial feature extraction from 28x28 grayscale images.

End-to-End Pipeline: Includes data normalization, image reshaping, and categorical classification.

Predictive Analytics: The interface provides not only the final classification but also the softmax probability distribution across all ten digit classes (0-9).

Interactive Interface: Supports user-driven input via image uploads or digital canvas interaction for immediate inference.
